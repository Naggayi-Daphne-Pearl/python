    - Tags represent the begin and end of elements. Name anything we want e.g <person><person>
    -Has self closing tags
    - Attributes: Keywords/value pairs on the opening tag of XML 
    -Serialise/De-Serialise: Convert data in one program into a common format that can be stored and/or transmitted between systems
