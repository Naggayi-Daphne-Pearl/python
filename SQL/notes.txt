                VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
    -UPDATE - used to update data in a database
        - Example 
            UPDATE customers

            WHERE condition(s) # if you dont add the condtion it will remove all the rows 

    -CREATE - used to create a new database or table 
        i.e 
        To create Database 
            - CREATE DATABASE database_name;
        To create table 
            - CREATE TABLE table_name (
                id INT PRIMARY KEY,
                name VARCHAR(255),
                address VARCHAR(255)
            );
        Add the semi colon at the end to show the end of command. 

    -ALTER - used to alter the structure of a database or table, such as adding or deleting columns
        -Using the Alter command to add column to table 
            ALTER TABLE table_name
                ADD column_name datatype; i.e ADD email VARCHAR(255)
        - Using Alter command to modify existing column

        -Example
            DROP DATABASE database_name;
            
    -INDEX - used to create and retrieve data from an index, which is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval
    - VIEW - used to create a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement
    - TRUNCATE - used to delete all data from a table, but unlike DELETE, it also resets the auto-increment counter of the table.
    
    - JOIN - used to join a table
        - INNER JOIN, which returns only rows that match the join condition
            SELECT * FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2
                ON table1.id = table2.id
        - OUTER JOIN, which returns all rows from both tables, including rows that do not match the join condition
            SELECT * FROM table1 LEFT OUTER JOIN table2
                ON table1.id = table2.id
        - CROSS JOIN, which returns the Cartesian product of the two tables (i.e., every possible combination of rows from both tables)
            SELECT * FROM table1 CROSS JOIN table2

        

    - FOREIGN KEY example 
        CREATE TABLE orders (
            id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers (id),
            product_id INTEGER REFERENCES products (id),
            quantity INTEGER NOT NULL
        );
