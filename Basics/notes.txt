Arithmetic in Python 
    Numbers: int, float, complex
    Operators: + - * / %

Booleans 
   - Values: True, False
   - Values are capitalized
   - Used to compare values 
   - Zero(0) is equal to False
   - An empty string for example bool("") is equal to False
   - Trival values are converted  to True
   - One (1) is equal to True

DateTime Module 
    - datetime is a module in the Python standard library that provides classes for working with dates and times.
    - datetime: This is a class that represents a single point in time with the date. 
    -date: This is a class that represents a date (year, month, and day) without a time.
    -time: This is a class that represents a time (hour, minute, second, and microsecond) without a date.
    -timedelta: This is a class that represents a duration, or the difference between two dates or times.
    -tzinfo: This is an abstract base class for time zone information objects.
    -timezone: This is a class that represents a fixed-offset time zone.

Functions 
    - Functions allow us to reuse code without repeating ourselves. 
    - start with keyword 'def'
    - call the function after definining it. 

Sets 
    - Each value in a set is called an element
    - a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. 
    -Sets are often used to store and manipulate collections of data that do not have a specific order or need to be unique.

Lists 
    - A list is an ordered collection of items that can be of any type, including other lists. 
    - Lists are often used to store and manipulate collections of data that have a specific order or need to be accessed by their position in the list.
    - To create a list in Python, you can use the [] operator or the list() function with a comma-separated list of elements
    - Lists can contain duplicate values
    - Lists allow for many data types

Dictionaries
    - A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.
    - Dictionaries are often used to store and manipulate data that is organized by keys, which can be used to access the corresponding values.
    - To create a dictionary in Python, you can use the {} operator with a comma-separated list of key-value pairs. 
    - The keys and values can be of any type, and the keys must be unique within the dictionary
    - You can also use the get() method to access the values of a dictionary by their keys. This method returns the value for the specified key, or a default value if the key is not found in the dictionary.
    - Values can have many data types 

Tuples 
    - A tuple is an immutable sequence type that is used to store a collection of elements
    - Tuples are similar to lists, but they are fixed in size and cannot be modified once created.
    - To create a tuple in Python, you can use the () operator or the tuple() function with a comma-separated list of elements while a list we use [] operator. 

Logging 
    - Allows you to record  progress and problems
    - Levels: Debug, INFO, WARN, ERROR, Critical

Fibonacci sequence
    - Memoization is a technique that is used to speed up the execution of a function by storing the results of previous function calls and returning the stored result instead of computing the result again. 
    - This can be particularly useful for functions that perform a lot of calculations or have a recursive structure, as it can significantly reduce the time and resources required to execute the function.
    - To implement memoization in a function, you can use a dictionary or another data structure to store the results of previous function calls.
    - Then, when the function is called, you can check if the result has already been computed and stored in the dictionary. If it has, you can return the stored result; if it hasn't, you can compute the result and store it in the dictionary for future use.

CSV FILES
    - CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are a simple and common way to store data in a tabular format, with each row representing a record and each column representing a field. 
    - CSV files are often used to exchange data between different applications and systems, as they can be easily imported and exported by a wide range of software.
    - Starts with A Header with the information about the values.
    - Each row is separated by commas. Each row is a record. Represented by a string.
    - Two commas in a row means data is missing 
    - It is a text files

List Comprehesion 
    -  It is used to create a list using a single line of code. 
    - It consists of an expression followed by the 'for' clause, then zero or more 'for' or 'if' clauses. 

Classes 
    - Classes is a template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behaviour of an object. 
    - defined class with the word 'class' 
    - Do not capitalize name in the fields. use lowercase 
    - classes are used to make objects 
    - the __init__ method is a simple method called when an object is created.  It is used intialize the objects' attributes
    - help() is used to get information about classes or its methods
