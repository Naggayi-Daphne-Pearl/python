Arithmetic in Python 
    Numbers: int, float, complex
    Operators: + - * / %

Booleans 
   - Values: True, False
   - Values are capitalized
   - Used to compare values 
   - Zero(0) is equal to False
   - An empty string for example bool("") is equal to False
   - Trival values are converted  to True
   - One (1) is equal to True

DateTime Module 
    - datetime is a module in the Python standard library that provides classes for working with dates and times.
    - datetime: This is a class that represents a single point in time with the date. 
    -date: This is a class that represents a date (year, month, and day) without a time.
    -time: This is a class that represents a time (hour, minute, second, and microsecond) without a date.
    -timedelta: This is a class that represents a duration, or the difference between two dates or times.
    -tzinfo: This is an abstract base class for time zone information objects.
    -timezone: This is a class that represents a fixed-offset time zone.

Functions 
    - Functions allow us to reuse code without repeating ourselves. 
    - start with keyword 'def'
    - call the function after definining it. 

Sets 
    - Each value in a set is called an element
    - a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. 
    -Sets are often used to store and manipulate collections of data that do not have a specific order or need to be unique.

Lists 
    - A list is an ordered collection of items that can be of any type, including other lists. 
    - Lists are often used to store and manipulate collections of data that have a specific order or need to be accessed by their position in the list.
    - To create a list in Python, you can use the [] operator or the list() function with a comma-separated list of elements
    - Lists can contain duplicate values
    - Lists allow for many data types

Dictionaries
    - A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.
    - Dictionaries are often used to store and manipulate data that is organized by keys, which can be used to access the corresponding values.
    - To create a dictionary in Python, you can use the {} operator with a comma-separated list of key-value pairs. 
    - The keys and values can be of any type, and the keys must be unique within the dictionary
    - You can also use the get() method to access the values of a dictionary by their keys. This method returns the value for the specified key, or a default value if the key is not found in the dictionary.
    - Values can have many data types
