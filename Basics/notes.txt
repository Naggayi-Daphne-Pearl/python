Implicit and Explicit Conversions 
    -Implicit conversion is where the interpreter helps us out and automatically converts one data type into another, without having to explicitly tell it to do so. 
    like when adding an int and a float
    - Explicit conversion is where we manually convert from one data type to another by calling the relevant function for the data type we want to convert to. 
    like printing a string with a int. we can manually change the int with str(int)
Arithmetic in Python 
    Numbers: int, float, complex
    Operators: + - * / %

Order of operations
   -The order of operations are to be calculated from left to right in the following order: 
     1.Parentheses ( ), { }, [ ]
     2.Exponents xe   (x**e)
     3.Multiplication * and Division /  
     4.Addition + and Subtraction -    
   -You might find the PEMDAS mnemonic device to be helpful in remembering the order.
   
In Python, text in between quotes -- either single or double quotes -- is a string data type. An integer is a whole number, without a fraction, while a float is a real number that can contain a fractional part. For example, 1, 7, 342 are all integers, while 5.3, 3.14159 and 6.0 are all floats. When attempting to mix incompatible data types, you may encounter a TypeError. You can always check the data type of something using the type() function.

Booleans 
   - Values: True, False
   - Values are capitalized
   - Used to compare values 
   - Zero(0) is equal to False
   - An empty string for example bool("") is equal to False
   - Trival values are converted  to True
   - One (1) is equal to True

DateTime Module 
    - datetime is a module in the Python standard library that provides classes for working with dates and times.
    - datetime: This is a class that represents a single point in time with the date. 
    -date: This is a class that represents a date (year, month, and day) without a time.
    -time: This is a class that represents a time (hour, minute, second, and microsecond) without a date.
    -timedelta: This is a class that represents a duration, or the difference between two dates or times.
    -tzinfo: This is an abstract base class for time zone information objects.
    -timezone: This is a class that represents a fixed-offset time zone.

Functions 
    - Functions allow us to reuse code without repeating ourselves. 
    - start with keyword 'def'
    - call the function after definining it. 

Sets 
    - Each value in a set is called an element
    - a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. 
    -Sets are often used to store and manipulate collections of data that do not have a specific order or need to be unique.

Lists 
    - A list is an ordered collection of items that can be of any type, including other lists. 
    - Lists are often used to store and manipulate collections of data that have a specific order or need to be accessed by their position in the list.
    - To create a list in Python, you can use the [] operator or the list() function with a comma-separated list of elements
    - Lists can contain duplicate values
    - Lists allow for many data types

Dictionaries
    - A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.
    - Dictionaries are often used to store and manipulate data that is organized by keys, which can be used to access the corresponding values.
    - To create a dictionary in Python, you can use the {} operator with a comma-separated list of key-value pairs. 
    - The keys and values can be of any type, and the keys must be unique within the dictionary
    - You can also use the get() method to access the values of a dictionary by their keys. This method returns the value for the specified key, or a default value if the key is not found in the dictionary.
    - Values can have many data types 

Tuples 
    - A tuple is an immutable sequence type that is used to store a collection of elements
    - Tuples are similar to lists, but they are fixed in size and cannot be modified once created.
    - To create a tuple in Python, you can use the () operator or the tuple() function with a comma-separated list of elements while a list we use [] operator. 

Logging 
    - Allows you to record  progress and problems
    - Levels: Debug, INFO, WARN, ERROR, Critical

Fibonacci sequence
    - Memoization is a technique that is used to speed up the execution of a function by storing the results of previous function calls and returning the stored result instead of computing the result again. 
    - This can be particularly useful for functions that perform a lot of calculations or have a recursive structure, as it can significantly reduce the time and resources required to execute the function.
    - To implement memoization in a function, you can use a dictionary or another data structure to store the results of previous function calls.
    - Then, when the function is called, you can check if the result has already been computed and stored in the dictionary. If it has, you can return the stored result; if it hasn't, you can compute the result and store it in the dictionary for future use.

CSV FILES
    - CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are a simple and common way to store data in a tabular format, with each row representing a record and each column representing a field. 
    - CSV files are often used to exchange data between different applications and systems, as they can be easily imported and exported by a wide range of software.
    - Starts with A Header with the information about the values.
    - Each row is separated by commas. Each row is a record. Represented by a string.
    - Two commas in a row means data is missing 
    - It is a text files

List Comprehesion 
    -  It is used to create a list using a single line of code. 
    - It consists of an expression followed by the 'for' clause, then zero or more 'for' or 'if' clauses. 

Classes 
    - Classes is a template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behaviour of an object. 
    - defined class with the word 'class' 
    - Do not capitalize name in the fields. use lowercase 
    - classes are used to make objects 
    - the __init__ method is a simple method called when an object is created.  It is used intialize the objects' attributes
    - help() is used to get information about classes or its methods
