Functions 
    - Functions allow us to reuse code without repeating ourselves. 
    - start with keyword 'def'
    - call the function after definining it. 

Sets 
    - Each value in a set is called an element
    - a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. 
    -Sets are often used to store and manipulate collections of data that do not have a specific order or need to be unique.

Lists 
    - A list is an ordered collection of items that can be of any type, including other lists. 
    - Lists are often used to store and manipulate collections of data that have a specific order or need to be accessed by their position in the list.
    - To create a list in Python, you can use the [] operator or the list() function with a comma-separated list of elements
    - Lists can contain duplicate values
    - Lists allow for many data types
